#+TITLE:Running VARPP-Rule: Modelling and Prediction for Pathogenic Variant Prediction in Rare Diseases

* Overview
** Content
The ~DataLad~ data set contains the follwing structure:

#+BEGIN_SRC 
+---genome-data
+---pre-trained-models
+---patientVcf
+---liftover
+---scratch
+---README.org
#+END_SRC
** Models
The ~DataLad~ data set can be seen as a software package, that comes with the necessary data and code pre-configured.
It contains two docker images:

1) ~gatk~ image: to run the ~picard~ ~LiftoverVcf~ tool, which allows to create 'lift' ~hg19~ annotation of a patient ~.vcf~ file to ~h38~. This is necessary, as the model data is annotated with the ~hg38~ data.
2) ~varpp-predict-utils~ image: this docker image contains the scripts we need for running ~VARPP-RuleFit~, ~predict~ or a combination of the two for a combined project workflow.
* Quick start: Set up the project
In order to run the model for a project, run the following in your desired folder location on the command line:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :eval never 
conda activate datalad # in case you have datalad installed on the system without conda, you do not need this step
git clone https://github.com/Hobbeist/varpp-project-datalad.git
cd varpp-project-datalad
#+END_SRC
